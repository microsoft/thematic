## Functions

|  [application2style(config)](./react.application2style.md) | Converts basic Application config to a CSS-compatible object suitable for merging with other styles that will be added to a component. |
|  [mark2style(config, datum)](./react.mark2style.md) | Converts a basic mark config to CSS-compatible object suitable for merging with other styles that will be added to a component.
