This is the web interface for Thematic, providing the ability to configure theme parameters, see examples of the theme in action, and download theme export files for various platforms.

Note that the codebase here may also be useful for finding examples of how to use Thematic directly. This application uses the Fluent UI component library, as well as charting with D3 and Vega, so examples of usage patterns can be found throughout.
