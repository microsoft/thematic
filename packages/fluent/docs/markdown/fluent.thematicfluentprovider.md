## ThematicFluentProvider variable

This component wraps the ThematicProvider and Fluent ThemeProvider to simplify instantiation. Just treat it like a typical Context.Provider, wrapping it around your app. Your Fluent controls should automatically inherit the Thematic colors as semantically applied by Fluent. You can use the context hooks for any of the three variants as you please: - useThematic from @<!-- -->thematic/react returns the normal thematic theme - useThematicFluent from this package returns the hybrid theme - useTheme from @<!-- -->fluentui/react returns the normal fluent theme
