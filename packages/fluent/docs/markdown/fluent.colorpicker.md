## ColorPicker variable

This is a simple ColorPicker that you can show users, allowing them to choose a custom accent color. It does not expose the background and nominal step properties, but may do so in the future. At the moment it isn't much different than a regular color picker, but exists to wrap up the theme parameterization and leave room for additional functionality. Note also that it does NOT expose an alpha control, because this is not allowed in thematic params.

```typescript
ColorPicker: FC<ColorPickerProps>
```
