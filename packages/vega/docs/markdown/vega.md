## Functions

|  Function | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [vega(theme, spec, options)](./vega.vega.md) | Themes a vega spec using its top-level config block This is pretty easy for most visual properties since our field names match closely See https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/config/. Our theme config will \_not\_ override config blocks that are already in the spec, so you can customize any mark defaults independently. |
