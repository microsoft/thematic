|  [vega(theme, spec, width, height)](./vega.vega.md) | Themes a vega spec using its top-level config block This is pretty easy for most visual properties since our field names match closely See https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/config/ TODO: allow specific overrides of any config block from the theme. For example, using a secondary sequential scale. |
