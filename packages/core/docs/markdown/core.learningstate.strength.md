## LearningState.strength property

This is a measure of the recall strength needed. If learning exposure happens frequently, this will increase slowly because the recall stays high. As time elapses between exposures, this increases because recall is more difficult. If the learning value reaches zero (i.e., there is too much time between exposures for any reasonable recall), then this resets.
