## Theme.nearest property

Returns a theme color that's the closest to a CSS color string we can find. Note that by default this uses the standard nominal scale with 20 entries so there is plenty of variety to choose from. Pass in a different scale instance if you want something else to choose from.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
nearest: (color: string, scale?: NominalColorScaleFunction) => Color;
```
