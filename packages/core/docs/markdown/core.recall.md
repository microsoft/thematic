## recall() function

Creates a scale that modulates a value in a manner comparable to human learning and recall. The idea is that exposure to a concept results in immediate recall, but over time that recall fades. However, repeat exposure increases the recall \_and\_ reduces the rate of forgetting.

In order to modulate the value over time, we need to keep track of the previous value and the previous learning strength. Therefore the input/output of this scale is an object with a strength and value prop. The first time you call the scale, you can omit this bit of tracked state, but subsequent calls should supply the output of the previous call. For all intents and purposes you can ignore the strength param, just make sure it is included.
