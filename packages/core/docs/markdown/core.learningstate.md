## LearningState interface

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface LearningState 
```

## Properties

|  Property | Modifiers | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  [strength](./core.learningstate.strength.md) |  | number | This is a measure of the recall strength needed. If learning exposure happens frequently, this will increase slowly because the recall stays high. As time elapses between exposures, this increases because recall is more difficult. If the learning value reaches zero (i.e., there is too much time between exposures for any reasonable recall), then this resets. |
|  [value](./core.learningstate.value.md) |  | number | Current value of the learning. When elapsed time is 0 (i.e., the learning was just applied), this will be 1.0. As time elapses and the learning fades, this declines toward 0. |
